# MiRCA

Hybrid Error Correction Tool for NGS Long Reads


We present MiRCA a new hybrid approach that detects and corrects errors using preassembled Illumina short reads. It uses an alignment-based approach, supports substitution, insertion and deletion errors, using pre-assembled short reads as a reference to correct MinIon long reads.
