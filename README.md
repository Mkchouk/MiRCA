# MiRCA

Hybrid Error Correction Tool for NGS Long Reads


We present MiRCA a new hybrid approach that detects and corrects errors using preassembled Illumina short reads. It uses an alignment-based approach, supports substitution, insertion and deletion errors, using pre-assembled short reads as a reference to correct MinIon long reads.

#####Requirements

- A Linux based operating system.
- Spades assembler v3.6 (at least) available in http://bioinf.spbau.ru/en
- BLAST+ v2.2.30plus (at least) available in https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download
- Celera Assembler v8.3 (at least) this step is optionnal. if you want to assemble the corrected Long reads.

#####Download MiRCA
MiRCA can be downloaded at : 
- https://github.com/Mkchouk/MiRCA

#####Install MiRCA
To install the tool, the user must download the file **MiRCA-master.zip** and extract it.
```
tar -xzf MiRCA-master.zip
```
#####Run MiRCA

The package contains one main script called ***MiRCA.sh*** that coordinates the execution of the whole process.

You must modify the MiRCA.sh file by adding the paths of short reads (.FASTA or .FQ)  and long reads reads (.FASTA). In the MiRCA.sh, you must change the directories of files results of spades and Blast+ in the current directory.

There are Two Mode in MiRCA:
- First Mode `Default Mode` (main.c): update the input and output files by changing the path of the alignment results file and the long file reads path.
- First Mode `Trim Mode` (main_trim.c): update the input and output files by changing the path of the alignment result file and the long file reads path (further explanation in main_trim.c).
